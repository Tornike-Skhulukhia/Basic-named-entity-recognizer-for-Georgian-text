# spiders to help collect world parliamentars name_surnames lists

# in the future, we may automate full process, but for now these spiders are just drafts of first steps
# until we learn what works best and how we should do it...

# Steps to do it in the future
## step 1) run get_parliamentarians_info.py file to start different spiders for parliamentarians retrieval
## step 2) remove duplicates
## step 3) translate data got from step 2 into Georgian if source is not Georgian
## step 4) briefly recheck that step 3 data is good enough and remove/fix some records if necessary
## step 5) add new names & surnames data into __init__.py file
